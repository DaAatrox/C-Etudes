# 8. Dice Rolling

Create a program which simulates rolling a 6 sided dice.
The user should be able to keep rolling until they choose to exit.
You can implement this as a menu, or through a special input the user must enter.

**Example Run**
```
Press ENTER to roll. Input Q to quit.
Rolling d6: 2

Rolling d6: 5

Rolling d6: 4

Rolling d6: 2
Q
Good bye! Nice to know you.
```
