# Average Coordinates

The program given in `coord_avg.c` is supposed to read 10 pairs of 2D coordinates, $(x_i, y_i)$, and print the average coordinate.
However, it does not work correctly.

Fix the program so that it compiles with no errors or warnings and correctly computes the average coordinate.

## Program Requirements

1. Read 10 sets of coordinates.
2. Accept 2 `float` values per coordinate.
3. Compute the average coordinate.
